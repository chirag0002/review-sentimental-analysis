# Review Sentiment Analysis

This project aims to display reviews along with sentiments expressed by users. The review data is fetched from a JSON file, and sentiment analysis is applied to highlight specific sentiments within the review text. Additionally, hovering over the highlighted sentiment reveals the topic of the sentence in a tooltip.
